In-Memory Todo Console Application - Basic Level Features
Target audience: Developer building the application and future contributors
Focus: Implement the 5 core basic features of a command-line todo app with clean, readable code
Success criteria:
- User can add a new task with a required title and optional description
- User can view all tasks showing: ID, status indicator ([ ] or [✓]), title, and description
- User can update the title or description of an existing task by providing its ID
- User can delete a task by its ID
- User can mark a task as complete or incomplete by its ID
- Application provides a clear, text-based menu with numbered options
- Runs in an infinite loop until the user explicitly chooses to exit
- All operations provide clear success/error feedback
- Invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent ID, empty title) are handled gracefully with helpful messages
- Application never crashes due to user input

Constraints:
- In-memory storage only — no file I/O, no database, no persistence across runs
- Use only Python standard library (no third-party packages)
- Task model must include at minimum: id (int), title (str), description (str or None), completed (bool)
- IDs are assigned sequentially starting from 1 and never reused in a single run
- Command-line interface must be simple and text-based
- Support only the 5 basic operations plus list and exit

Not building:
- Persistence to disk or file
- Task priorities, due dates, categories, tags, or subtasks
- Sorting or filtering of task list
- Undo/redo functionality
- Multiple users or authentication
- GUI or web interface
- Unit tests (reserved for future phase)
- Advanced input parsing libraries
